# What we talked about today

## UML DIAGRAM FEEDBACK FROM FELIPE 11-05-2023
-  constructor student management
-  arrow from student management to student class is reversed
-  tasks to student arrow/relation is reversed
- attribute Tasks List<Tasks> attribute is not necessary if the above is fixed
- rules agreements tasks should be a dependency instead of association 
- admin management has the student management - we should look if itâ€™s dependent or associated 
- missing some public and privates in agreements, rules, tasks
- look in the most: relationships, direction arrows, dependency? or association?
- cardinality: the student management has 1 or more tasks
- the us of list, arrays 

## PROJECT PLAN FEEDBACK FROM FELIPE 11-05-2023
- make prototype of the rest of the forms
- product breakdown miro = nice
- project plan is overall nice
- make sure to include the minutes after meeting
- we dont really need to make an agenda, but write about what is discussed. basically documentation of all feedback from teachers. write down the minutes of the meetings.
- create a label for that
- communication is going pretty fine
- working alone at home or at school is a risk
