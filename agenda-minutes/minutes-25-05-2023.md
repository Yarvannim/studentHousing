# WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY
Today we had a talk with Felipe for our group project. We talked about our UML diagram, it was overall quite good but we had forgotten one cardinality, and also we used the plural version of the class naming instead of using the singular naming. After this we talked about our code, and Felipe said we were quite advanced so we were allowed to start using a database instead of using file storage which is of course much better. He was also happy that our calendar is not hard coded. So from today onwards we are going to convert our application to use a database.
## UML DIAGRAM FEEDBACK FROM FELIPE
- Check cardinality better
- Don't use plural form when you shouldn't
## CODE FEEDBACK FROM FELIPE
- Looking very good
- Happy that agenda is not hardcoded
- Allowed to use database from now on
