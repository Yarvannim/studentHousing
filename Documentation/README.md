## Current situation 
At the moment there is no program to keep track of what needs to be done and everything is done just by communicating verbally. The tasks that need to be done are regular stuff in a student housing such as cleaning the shared facilities, groceries, garbage disposal. The students get updated news on tasks by having one of the employees go by the student housing building. 

## Problem description
Even though there are rules people just donâ€™t listen to them. So now the client wants to make a program to make it easier to know who has to do what. At the moment the appointed people are not cleaning the shared facilities, groceries are not done on time and also not everybody pays for the shared items. Garbage disposal is not done on time, and currently parties and gatherings are completely unannounced.

## Project goal
The goal of this project is to make an application where the students within the housing can record and see agreements made between each other. But there should also be a possibility to anonymously report problems within the student house. Futhermore the application is meant to fix the problems within the communication, since there are also problems with the daily cleaning in the student housing they want this to be solved so the cleaning actually gets done this also goes for the garbage disposal.

What we are planning to create is basically a smart home screen but for the studenthousing situation. You will be able to do everything for this one singular big screen. 

### Risks
-	Time limit
    -   Focus on the moscow
    -   Divide the tasks well so everything is done on time
-	Limited C# knowledge
    -   Ask eachother for help 
    -   Search up things you might not know yet
-	Focus on too many tasks
    -   Focus on your assigned tasks
    -   Only do another task when you have finished your first
-	File persistence not database
-   Project members getting sick
    -   Make sure we finish tasks before their deadline so if someone is sick one day we will still reach our deadline
-   Project members not doing their part
    -   Have a stern talk with them or report them to the teacher if they keep not making their part

## Deliverable
-	Student housing software
-	Manual / Documentation

## Non-Deliverable
-	Hardware to run the program on
-   Touchscreens for interacting with the program
-	Hosting?

## Constraints 
-	C# windows forms
-	Only use knowledge that we gained this period
-	Information must be saved in files not database
-	Fontys GitLab
-	Canvas for delivering the project
-	Week 17 deadline
